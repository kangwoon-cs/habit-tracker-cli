# File name: habit_tracker
# Description: This is a simple command-line based habit tracker that allows users to check in on daily habits.
# For each predefined habit, the program asks a yes/no question and records the user's responses
# along with the current date.
# The habits are stored as a dictionary for flexibility and future extensibility.
# Daily logs are saved to a plain text file (habit_log.txt), with the date and responses recorded.
# This tool helps build consistency by making habit tracking quick, lightweight, and file-based.
